use Stack

## Clone inside your ~/.config/xmonad folder
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad
$ git clone https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad-contrib
```

(Sources and binaries donâ€™t usually go into ~/.config. In our case, however, it avoids complexities related to Haskell build tools and lets us focus on the important bits of XMonad installation.)
